<h1> Group Reflections </h1>

<h2>Cassie </h2>
<p> What went well: I thought that the use of meeting notes and recorded meetings was really good so that those who had prior commitments could still attend meetings and be involved. I also think that the use of the chat being used for main communication and the teams for links was a great way to divide up the important with the unimportant. Using google docs to work on this assignment with others was also really good as it allowed people to provide suggestions and comments rather than just editing each other's work.
<br> What could have been improved: I think if we were to do this over again, one thing that could be improved would be to discuss the Our Projects idea more towards the beginning in order to tailor some of the IT Industries and IT Tech info to relate more to what would be required for us to know for the project.
<br> One thing that was surprising: One thing I found surprising was everyone's attitude remained completely positive, happy and we all got along great. It can be easy to get frustrated in group projects and not agree with one person or the other, but I do think everyone worked really well together and it was a pleasure.
<br>One thing I have learned about working in groups: One thing I have learned about working in groups is that it’s very easy to fall into roles. I think in future I would try to take more of the backseat and allow others to feel more comfortable delegating and providing ideas as I found I can be sometimes a little direct and overbearing.

<h2>Daniel </h2>
<p>What went well: I thought that our collaboration as a group was tremendous. Everyone had their roles set in stone pretty early. I also think that using a Google Doc was the best way to do this assignment as it allowed every group member to edit the document at the same time, making collaboration and editing extremely easy.
<br>What could have been improved: I think we could have scheduled meetings early on instead of doing it pretty last minute. As a result, I couldn’t attend some of the meetings.
<br>One thing that was surprising: One thing that was surprising to me was that I learnt a lot about myself during this assignment. I normally tend to stay quiet and not ask questions but gaining clarity from other group members was really refreshing and gave me the confidence to ask more.
<br>One thing I have learned about working in groups: One thing I have learnt about working in groups is that I may need to read over other people’s work so that I don’t repeat what has been said so that they don’t overlap with each other.

<h2> Rodrigo </h2>
<p>What went well: The collaboration was very smooth, there was effective communication throughout the process, and everybody knew their responsibilities and roles. Using Google docs and Microsoft teams was an assertive idea, features such as same time collaboration, chats, and meeting recordings made a huge impact.
<br> What could have been improved: The only area of improvement I can think of is the organisation of meetings. Oftenly, the meeting time was agreed upon with short notice, which led to occasions where team members could not assist. Also maybe a couple of presencial meetings could work for nex time.
<br> One thing that was surprising: I was surprised to see how everybody contributed in each stage of the project. There was no one that did not share their opinion and it always felt that everybody was giving it the importance it deserved.
<br> One thing I have learned about working in groups: I learned that multicultural teams are very valuable. We had a mix of different cultures that complemented each other very well.

<h2>Simon</h2>
<p>What went well: The group did really well working together and communicating ensuring that everyone is able to do their parts and create a website that focuses on all the key details of the assignment
<br>What could have been improved: Maybe what could have been improved on was the calls and the meetings, with having everyone picking a date that they are free and having everyone making sure that they can make it to the calls.
<br>One thing that was surprising: One thing that was surprising was that everyone wrote a lot of stuff with their parts showing how committed we all are which is a very good thing to have when doing group projects
<br>One thing I have learned about working in groups: One thing that I learned is that communicating well and ensuring that you do your own given part as early as possible prevents everyone from stressing when it comes to the due date.

<h2>Cameron</h2>
<p>What went well: Collaborating with other people went really well, as we used microsoft teams, github and  google docs to work on everything together. Having these tools available to us really helped in understanding what we needed to get done, communicate our thoughts, and see everyone’s progress.
<br> What could have been improved: Something that I feel like I could have improved is working on my research tasks earlier. By working on them earlier, I can improve the quality of my writing and sections tremendously.
<br>One thing that was surprising: Something that I found surprising was even though the delegation of different tasks split among 7 of us, there was still a lot of work that needed to be done.
<br> One thing I have learned about working in groups: I think that working with people that take charge of the group’s direction and assignments really helps the team progress through their work. Working together with these kinds of people really helps others like me, who do not like to take charge, understand the position and role they play in the team environment.

<h2>Afiq</h2>
<p>What went well: Working with other members in the group has been nothing but positive. Everyone tends to help if one of us has any difficulties and has been supportive if new ideas are being recommended.
<br>What could have been improved: Meeting times that have been scheduled. Since everyone is unable to agree on a short notice of meeting arrangements, it is hard to gather everyone to discuss our project.
<br>One thing that was surprising: How everyone has contributed well and catching up on tasks in their designated parts even without attending all the meetings that's been held.
<br>One thing I have learned about working in groups: It is important for roles to be assigned within a group. It is good to have someone to take the lead and everyone just kind of play their part, so that there is no miscommunication and any problems that would occur</p>

<h2>Andrew</h2>
<p>What went well: Communicating frequently over the Microsoft Teams app and having weekly meetings really made the collaboration process coherent, as everyone was given a medium to express their ideas effectively. I also found that assigning most of the tasks to each individual person at the beginning of this project made it easier to keep track of what needed to be done and also ensured nothing was missed.
<br>What could have been improved: Organisation and time management was something that could be improved for assignment 2. As everyone had busy schedules, it was hard to find meeting times that suited everyone.
<br>One thing that was surprising: Something that surprised me was how everyone knew what part they had to play. Despite not having all members in each of our meetings, everyone took initiative to rewatch the recorded versions and find out what they were required to do.
<br>One thing I have learned about working in groups: One thing that I’ve learnt through this group project was how beneficial it is to have a leader in the group. Having someone with an authoritative personality that instigates which direction to follow really brings the group together and boosts the morale of members.</p>
