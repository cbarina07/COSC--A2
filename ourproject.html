<h1>PTV Rewards <img src="myki.jpg" alt height="150px;"></h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p> This project “PTV Rewards System” is a system that tracks users when they touch on and off when using trams, trains or buses. When touching on and off, it will add a point to the user’s selected account that they would have needed to create on the PTV app. By using this system, it will encourage people to use public transport the right way, hoping to minimise the total amount of myki fines that is given out in a year. Moreover, with these enticing rewards, people are more likely to rely less on cars and use public transport making the environment a much more sustainable place.
        </p>
<hr>
<h2>Functions</h2>
<p>When a user taps onto a vehicle that requires a MYKI, their MYKI fare is deducted from their account, but replaced by credits in the PTV Rewards App. These credits allow the user to be able to redeem any amount of coupons within their credit limit. These credits can be saved up for larger ticket coupons, or used regularly to redeem rewards posted by businesses in the user's current location. The rewards advertised can be anything from 5 dollars off of a meal at Fancy Hanks, to 15 percent off select stores. The more a user taps on and chooses to take public transport, the more credits they are able to earn.
<br>
<br>
Every quarter, PTV will hold a prize draw automatically available to eligible riders who have earned over a certain threshold of credits. These prize draws include high ticket items such as an iPhone, gaming console or bike. Not only will the user be eligible for these high ticket prize draws and daily rewards, but if a user opts to take public transport to an eligible event such as a concert, festival or location (such as an art gallery or museum), they will have an opportunity to scan a PTV QR code that provides a further reward such as a free drink, concert item (such as a light up fan or balloon), or a certain percent off from a gallery store.
Businesses that choose to partake will offer up rewards to users who utilise the PTV Rewards app. These rewards will be listed in order from largest deals to smallest deals. Therefore, businesses who wish to have more visibility and draw more customers to their store can opt to provide larger ticket coupons to incentivise traffic to their business. Businesses who consistently provide coupons and deals will also be advertised on select trams and trains as being involved in the PTV Rewards. This is to ensure that PTV Rewards is recognised and so are the businesses involved.
<br>
<br>
Users will be able to view the current rewards in a chosen radius around their location, or view rewards available in a specified location by the user. That way, the user can decide whether or not to use their credits now or save them for later when they may be in that chosen area.
Any credits redeemed by the user will not detract from the overall credits which allow them to be eligible for the prize draws. After each prize draw however, the credit slate is wiped clean so that all users start from 0 credits to work towards the threshold credit for the quarterly prize draw. This does not erase any consumable credit points however, and any credits saved up for rewards or coupons will still remain in the credit wallet.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Upon installing and opening PTV Rewards, there will be a prompt for the user to register and login into the app, requiring a username, password and email. After this has been done, there will be another prompt to link their MYKI. For the link to occur, the user must input the 15-digit number at the back of their MYKI card. Once this is complete, the user will be able to access the various features of PTV rewards.
<br>
<br>
The main feature of this app would be the credit wallet. The credit wallet feature would show not only the credits that have been obtained by touching on, but also some images of some of the deals that can be redeemed through the credits. When tapping onto one of the images, the app would transition to another feature, having the whole list of coupons with images that can be redeemed. When this list appears, the coupons would be ordered from the largest to smallest whilst also using the users geographical location and arranging the deals that are closest to farthest. Furthermore, the deals that the user can afford using their credits are highlighted or are in colour whereas the ones that they cannot are in greyscale. Another feature within PTV Rewards would be a prize draw tab which shows the next prize that is available for users who frequently touch on. This tab would display not only past prizes, but also the winner’s username (given that they choose not to remain anonymous). To avoid users missing out, these prizes would occasionally cycle whilst also adding in new prizes. There will also be a QR code feature which allows the camera of the user’s phone to be opened and scan a QR code. It must be a valid PTV Rewards QR code or there will be an error message. These QR codes act as a check-in system that enables the user to obtain a reward at an event. For example, if the event is a concert, a possible reward for scanning the QR code could be having a free drink during the concert. For this to work, the user must also scan their MYKI right after scanning the QR code.
<br>
<br>
Moreover, there will also be a PTV Rewards website which gives information about the app and allows restaurants and other businesses to register to be able to give rewards. This must be accepted by PTV before the business can have their reward in the app. There will be a feature on this website that is for businesses to register and log in. Upon logging in, the website will show extra tabs such as statistics, your rewards. In the statistics section, the website will show how many people have redeemed this reward and a monthly graph of this. In the ‘your rewards’ tab, the website will show the rewards that the business has decided to give to users. Whilst in this tab, there will also be an option to add, remove or disable a certain reward.</p>

<h2>Incentives (Consumers, Businesses and PTV)</h2>
<p>
The first category is incentives for users. On that note, the category is divided into three main approaches, where all of them are supported by the “rewards by credits'' system. In approach number one, the user is offered the opportunity to redeem their saved credits on food, drinks, discount coupons, and more. Just by using their myki properly, they will have a list of hundreds of benefits to choose from which will vary depending on the amount of credits that the user is willing to redeem. Some examples could be a “15% discount coupon” on select items at H&M, ”1 small flat white” at Puzzle Caffe, or a “10% discount” on the local kebab restaurant. The second approach consists of raffle. Only users who have reached a minimum of credits in a defined period of time will be eligible for the prizes, these will be of greater value than the options offered above. Some examples of the prizes could be smart phones, tickets to a concert/sport event, televisions, vacation giveaways, computers and more. These appealing prizes persuade users to constantly and repeatedly use their myki in order to have a chance to win something of far greater value than what they are spending on transport fares. In addition, the third approach consists of  “Special event rewards''. The users that decide to use public transport in order to get to selected events will get a reward upon arrival. Concerts, footy matches, festivals, or theater plays are examples of special events and discounts on merchandise stores or a beverage of choice are examples of rewards that users will receive.
<br>
<br>
The second category is incentives for Business, Restaurants, and PTV. The category divides into two, restaurants and businesses that offer the redeemable rewards, and PTV with the raffle prizes. Firstly, by partnering with myki in the reward system, businesses will instantly join a network of thousands of public transport users. This will generate inevitable organic advertising. By being included on the list of options, business will be able to connect with customers, who otherwise would not have been reachable before; additionally, this will lead to a potential increment in sales/orders, and flow of customers. Moreover, depending on the business involvement and commitment with the project, advertising on public transport will also be available. Exclusive publicity spots on trams, metro trains, and buses will be reserved for the most loyal “Rewards by Credits” providers. Secondly, by doing the raffle, PTV is presented with a win-win situation. They will have a large number of users that utilize myki properly with the objective of being eligible for the raffle. Additionally, since there will be several raffles in a year they will also secure a constant flow all the time. The prizes can be paid with just a fraction of all revenue obtained.

<h2>Similar Projects and How Ours Differs</h2>
<p>
Customer loyalty programs are used extensively throughout different businesses as a marketing medium to encourage loyalty and repetitive purchases, overall benefiting long-term business. The leading edge of this system in the Australian market is Coles’ Flybuys customer rewards program. Participating members of this program can accrue points by spending money with participating organisations including Coles, Kmart, Liquorland, Officeworks and Target. With these points, customers can then redeem specific rewards such as getting discounts for future purchases, getting a free reward from the accompanying ‘Rewards Store’ or even booking a getaway. Our PTV rewards system would have the same base framework, that being - users accumulate points and trade them in for rewards. However, what differs from this is that rather than spending a certain amount at a store to earn points, the PTV rewards app collects points from every tap you make with your MYKI card, making the user experience effortless. Furthermore, the PTV rewards program is not exclusive towards big brands and corporate companies, but rather embraces local businesses too, enabling any business to join with the rewards.
<br>
<br>
Another well-known discount system is Unidays, a different sort of program that is targeted to the student demographic and provides instant discounts without the accumulation of points. Students can receive special discounts from big brands such as Apple, Dominos and Adidas, just for being a student. This system is tremendously beneficial towards students; however it does not reach a greater audience as the PTV Rewards app is projected to outreach. Our rewards app is all-inclusive of any demographic, providing discounts and benefits to anyone that uses public transport. Moreover, the points system embedded in our rewards app grants frequent travellers who spend more time and money on public transport to gain more benefits as a result. This ensures that high merit customers are being accounted for over the sporadic users of PTV, opposing Unidays’ system of allowing every student to get equal rewards.
