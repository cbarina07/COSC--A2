<h1>PTV Rewards</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>Functions</h2>
<p>When a user taps onto a vehicle that requires a MYKI, their MYKI fare is deducted from their account, but replaced by credits in the PTV Rewards App. These credits allow the user to be able to redeem any amount of coupons within their credit limit. These credits can be saved up for larger ticket coupons, or used regularly to redeem rewards posted by businesses in the user's current location. The rewards advertised can be anything from 5 dollars off of a meal at Fancy Hanks, to 15 percent off select stores. The more a user taps on and chooses to take public transport, the more credits they are able to earn.
<br>
<br>
Every quarter, PTV will hold a prize draw automatically available to eligible riders who have earned over a certain threshold of credits. These prize draws include high ticket items such as an iPhone, gaming console or bike. Not only will the user be eligible for these high ticket prize draws and daily rewards, but if a user opts to take public transport to an eligible event such as a concert, festival or location (such as an art gallery or museum), they will have an opportunity to scan a PTV QR code that provides a further reward such as a free drink, concert item (such as a light up fan or balloon), or a certain percent off from a gallery store.
Businesses that choose to partake will offer up rewards to users who utilise the PTV Rewards app. These rewards will be listed in order from largest deals to smallest deals. Therefore, businesses who wish to have more visibility and draw more customers to their store can opt to provide larger ticket coupons to incentivise traffic to their business. Businesses who consistently provide coupons and deals will also be advertised on select trams and trains as being involved in the PTV Rewards. This is to ensure that PTV Rewards is recognised and so are the businesses involved.
<br>
<br>
Users will be able to view the current rewards in a chosen radius around their location, or view rewards available in a specified location by the user. That way, the user can decide whether or not to use their credits now or save them for later when they may be in that chosen area.
Any credits redeemed by the user will not detract from the overall credits which allow them to be eligible for the prize draws. After each prize draw however, the credit slate is wiped clean so that all users start from 0 credits to work towards the threshold credit for the quarterly prize draw. This does not erase any consumable credit points however, and any credits saved up for rewards or coupons will still remain in the credit wallet.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Upon installing and opening PTV Rewards, there will be a prompt for the user to register and login into the app, requiring a username, password and email. After this has been done, there will be another prompt to link their MYKI. For the link to occur, the user must input the 15-digit number at the back of their MYKI card. Once this is complete, the user will be able to access the various features of PTV rewards.
<br>
<br>
The main feature of this app would be the credit wallet. The credit wallet feature would show not only the credits that have been obtained by touching on, but also some images of some of the deals that can be redeemed through the credits. When tapping onto one of the images, the app would transition to another feature, having the whole list of coupons with images that can be redeemed. When this list appears, the coupons would be ordered from the largest to smallest whilst also using the users geographical location and arranging the deals that are closest to farthest. Furthermore, the deals that the user can afford using their credits are highlighted or are in colour whereas the ones that they cannot are in greyscale. Another feature within PTV Rewards would be a prize draw tab which shows the next prize that is available for users who frequently touch on. This tab would display not only past prizes, but also the winner’s username (given that they choose not to remain anonymous). To avoid users missing out, these prizes would occasionally cycle whilst also adding in new prizes. There will also be a QR code feature which allows the camera of the user’s phone to be opened and scan a QR code. It must be a valid PTV Rewards QR code or there will be an error message. These QR codes act as a check-in system that enables the user to obtain a reward at an event. For example, if the event is a concert, a possible reward for scanning the QR code could be having a free drink during the concert. For this to work, the user must also scan their MYKI right after scanning the QR code.
<br>
<br>
Moreover, there will also be a PTV Rewards website which gives information about the app and allows restaurants and other businesses to register to be able to give rewards. This must be accepted by PTV before the business can have their reward in the app. There will be a feature on this website that is for businesses to register and log in. Upon logging in, the website will show extra tabs such as statistics, your rewards. In the statistics section, the website will show how many people have redeemed this reward and a monthly graph of this. In the ‘your rewards’ tab, the website will show the rewards that the business has decided to give to users. Whilst in this tab, there will also be an option to add, remove or disable a certain reward.</p>
