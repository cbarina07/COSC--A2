        <h2> Compare and contrast ideal jobs for everyone in group </h2>
        <p> Within the realm of IT, there are many different career pathways one can pursue, from cybernetics and robotics, to data science and industry development. IT can be applied to many different areas and it's no surprise that within our own group, there would be many different pathways and career options that are of interest.  Out of the 7 people in the group, there are 4 people who have similar ideal jobs for their future careers and 3 whose ideal career pathways lead elsewhere. Starting off with Afiq who wants to be a program developer, Daniel and Andrew as front-end web developers and Simon who aspires to be a software engineer. All these jobs appear to be quite closely related as most fall into the same area in terms of programming. On the other hand, Cassie wants to be an criminal intelligence analyst which works alongside law enforcement,analysing intelligence collected around the world in order to identify threats and make decisions. Cameron’s ideal job is quality assurance tester, which is different from the others as he ensures that the business’s product is in good quality. Finally, Rodrigo aspires to be a cloud consultant and work alongside data analytics in Google cloud professional services. Thus it is likely Rodrigo would be focusing on familiarising companies with available cloud computing services, helping them to make decisions that benefit their own agenda and operations. </p>

        <h2> What common elements are there? </h2>
        <p> Some common elements are that all of our ideal jobs link to Information Technology in some way.  One of which is that the students who have their ideal job as front-end web developers can use the same application as those who aspire to be a program developer and a software engineer. An example of an application that can be used could be Atom, which allows the users to choose either html, which would focus more on web developing, which suits best for Daniel and Andrew, or Java and Python which will focus more on program developing which suits best for Simon and Afiq. Moreover, all these ideal jobs have one common element that comes into play, that is all of them incorporated in analysing something to achieve the end result. For example, front-end web developers must analyse first on how they would create a website that would align with their businesses motto while those that are interested in working on programs need to analyse how they code in a way that would meet the business’s objectives. As such, it will apply the same to Cameron’s ideal job that is to analyse the products to ensure that they are in good quality, while for Cassie’s she would be analysing criminal intelligence and lastly Rodrigo analysing on cloud computing services that will help make better decisions and benefit the business’s agenda and operations.</p>

        <h2>What differentiates each position from the others?</h2>
        <p> What differentiates each position from the others is that for front-end web developers, they actually focus on creating websites which none of the other career paths focuses on. Same with the programming, which focuses more on using python and code in a way that ensures that computer software and functions work properly. While with a quality assurance tester, it ensures that all products are made in a quality fashion, which none of the other career paths do, this specific career path will not be focusing on using java, python or HTML. Lastly, for the cloud computing services, it is mainly focusing on benefitting the business’s agenda and operations which is different from the others. </p>

        <h2>How similar or different are your career paths across the group?</h2>
        <p> Program developer is a very similar career path to front-end web developers and cloud consultants as programmers need certain skills to code well. Some of these certain, hard skills that programmers are required to earn is web developing and cloud computing. As you can see, these skills clearly align with some of the other students in our group with their career paths. Hence, those that would want to choose a front-end web developer or a cloud consultant as their career paths, they would also need to have a deep understanding of other IT career paths, showing that these paths are not stand-alone. Furthermore, the career paths that have just been listed are very different to Cameron’s ideal job (quality assurance tester) as it does not require heavy understanding in web programming or cloud computing when pursuing this career as it requires a more hands on to check if the products are in good quality. </p>
