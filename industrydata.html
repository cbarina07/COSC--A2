<h2>How do the IT specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h2>
<p>Industry required IT specific skills ranking in group:
  <br>
  1.  JavaScript
  <br>
  2.  Structured Query Language (SQL)
  <br>
  3.  Python, Java, C/C++
  <br>
  4.  HTML, CSS, C#, cloud computing
  <br>
  5.  3D design (Maya, MudBox)
  <br>
  6.  Node, LESS/SASS, PHP, Perl, DNS, VPN and BGP knowledge.
<br>
<br>
In the report conducted by Burning Glass Technologies (March 2018) regarding the ‘Skills in Greatest Demand’, the top 3 skills sought after by employees were SQL, JavaScript and JAVA. Upon researching the relevant jobs of each group member, all 3 of these skills were a key requirement for multiple jobs. JavaScript was the most prominent IT specific skill across all our group members’ ideal jobs and the second most sought after skill in the research program conducted. Following this, SQL was the next most recurring skill in our teams’ ideal jobs, which paralleled the study’s ranked one most demanded skill. Thus, in terms of demand from employers SQL, JavaScript and Java are seen to be the most sought-after skills in the industry as supported by our own groups ideal jobs skill requirements. Going down the list, graphic design was the next highest skill within our collective skill requirements, ranking at 10th followed by Microsoft C# ranked at 12th. Although this skill’s position ranking was much lower than the rest, the actual difference in job postings between the positions of 1st and 10th was a mere 1,502 postings. Furthermore, when compared to the same study performed by Burning Glass Technologies in May 24, 2017, graphic design did not make it within the ranking, placing it out of the top 25 most specialised skills in the industry. As a result, our group’s IT specific skills mirrored the importance as the rankings proposed by the Burning Glass Technologies’ 2018 study to a degree; with new skills being in demand as the technology industry broadens in scope.</p>

<h2>How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h2>
<p>Industry required general skills ranking in group:
  <br>
  1.  Communication
  <br>
  2.  Teamwork + Problem-solving
  <br>
  3.  Detail-oriented
  <br>
  4.  Leadership
  <br>
  5.  Analytic + Time management
  <br>
  6.  Coaching, mathematical expertise, troubleshooting, presentation, multitasking, customer service
<br>
<br>
After extensive research on the general skills necessary on job recruitment sites such as SEEK and Indeed, the majority of our groups’ ideal jobs requirements shared similar general skills paired with a few industry specific ones. The number one basic skill that all these careers had in common was – communication skills. The next ranked general skill in our group was a tie between teamwork and problem-solving skills, which appeared in almost all our ideal jobs. Most jobs nowadays require some form of teamwork or collaboration whether it be through group projects or discussions with clients, consequently an employee’s ability to work in a team effectively is favoured. Problem-solving skills were considered just as important as teamwork skills which is reasonable considering the majority of our jobs are IT based. Jobs such as programming and software engineering would require a great deal of problem-solving as certain tasks would require problems to be broken down into smaller ones in order to find the best effective solution.
<br>
<br>
Our third most common general skill in our ideal jobs was the ability to pay attention to detail as seen in the jobs as a programmer, quality assurance games tester, software engineer and cloud consultant. A quality assurance tester is a great example of a career that highly values people with this skill as they need someone that is capable of looking at the fine details of games and pinpoint any minor inconvenience that may be present before its release. Leadership skill is ranked 4th  and analytic and time-management skills are tied at 5th; showing more value in certain positions in companies. Last in the rankings of general skills are mathematical expertise, troubleshooting, presentation, multitasking, customer service and coaching. These types of skills are mainly industry specific such as mathematical skills are highly sought after in programming and not necessary for front-end developers as they focus on the ‘looks’ of programs whilst programmers write the actual functions and code.
<br>
<br>
When comparing our collective skill requirements to ‘Skills in Greatest Demand’, a study conducted by Burning Glass Technologies (Burning Glass Technologies, February 2018), it was apparent that some skills were ranked vastly different. Communication skills remained a number 1 priority at ranked 1 alongside problem-solving skills which was placed 2nd in the studies ranking. Teamwork came at 5th and detail-oriented skills came 7th. This variance in rankings to our own could be an indication of requirements from broader jobs in the IT field, illustrating how vast the industry is and how different the skills may be in each profession.</p>

<h2>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</h2>
<h3>Cassie</h3>
<p>I found most of the burning glass data quite similar to what I expected for my ideal job. It was interesting to see however that technical support and customer service skills were ranked so high in the tech industry. It is interesting to think that even though I might not want to pursue a customer service/ technical support role, my current experience in these roles may very well help me down the line when applying for other IT jobs. I also found it quite interesting that most of the highest sort after skills were closely related to the current IT course we are all enrolled in. My opinion and goals for my ideal job have changed slightly in that it feels more and more reachable for me. </p>

<h3>Andrew</h3>
<p>After looking at the Burning Glass data, my opinion on my ideal job has remained the same. Most of the top ranked skills in the data were already key requirements in my ideal job; however I was surprised to see how valuable good communication skills are for employers as not one other general skill came close to it. I now realise that some of the IT skills, like Python, are not as valuable in the industry level as I thought it would be. This broadened my view of the IT industry, allowing me to adjust my priorities to other skills of higher importance.</p>

<h3>Afiq</h3>
<p>After reviewing the burning glass data, my view on my ideal job is still the same. Even though I do not meet every key factor on the job requirement, it made me realise I have unique potentials that can be invested into the job. However, I do have to work on the lacking needs from me to thrive in the IT world and not just focus on one programming language which is Python.
</p>

<h3>Rodrigo</h3>
<p>My opinion towards my ideal job has not changed. Nonetheless, the Burning Glass data helped me realise I was not paying enough attention to some of the expected skill sets. With this data I can now refocus my opinion and act upon it. At the same time, the fact that our course covers several topics related to these skills is very reassuring.</p>

<h3>Cameron</h3>
<p>My ideal job has not changed. The Burning Glass data did shed some light on other job requirements, as well as some of the most important aspects of a lot of Information Technology jobs. The data has helped me realise the things I need to improve on, the things I already know ,and some new things that I should learn.</p>

<h3>Daniel</h3>
<p>My opinion on my ideal job has not changed after looking at the Burning Glass data because I imagine I already have acquired some of the IT-specific and general skills. I believe that in the near future, I will be able to develop the skills that I have not yet gained. These skills include communication, leadership, Javascript and cloud computing.</p>

<h3>Simon</h3>
<p>After having a look at the burning glass data, I am still remaining the same opinion for my ideal job. With the technical support and dealing with consumers being positioned so high in the tech industry, they were already the important requirements for me in my current jobs so I have already acquired these skills pretty well. I also realised now that python is not as important as I thought it would be, it made me have a better insight that I should set my priorities straight and realise that Python is not the only important thing to learn when it comes to the IT industry.</p>
