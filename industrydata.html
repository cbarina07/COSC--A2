<h2>How do the IT specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h2>
<p>In the report conducted by Burning Glass Technologies (March 2018) regarding the ‘Skills in Greatest Demand’, the top 3 skills sought after by employees were SQL, JavaScript and JAVA. Upon researching the relevant jobs of each group member, all 3 of these skills were a key requirement for multiple jobs. JavaScript was the most prominent IT specific skill across all our group members’ ideal jobs and the second most sought after skill in the research program conducted. Following this, SQL was the next most recurring skill in our teams’ ideal jobs, which paralleled the study’s ranked one most demanded skill. Thus, in terms of demand from employers SQL, JavaScript and Java are seen to be the most sought-after skills in the industry as supported by our own groups ideal jobs skill requirements. Going down the list, graphic design was the next highest skill within our collective skill requirements, ranking at 10th followed by Microsoft C# ranked at 12th. Although this skill’s position ranking was much lower than the rest, the actual difference in job postings between the positions of 1st and 10th was a mere 1,502 postings. Furthermore, when compared to the same study performed by Burning Glass Technologies in May 24, 2017, graphic design did not make it within the ranking, placing it out of the top 25 most specialised skills in the industry. As a result, our group’s IT specific skills mirrored the importance as the rankings proposed by the Burning Glass Technologies’ 2018 study to a degree; with new skills being in demand as the technology industry broadens in scope.</p>

<h2>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</h2>
<h3>Cassie</h3>
<p>I found most of the burning glass data quite similar to what I expected for my ideal job. It was interesting to see however that technical support and customer service skills were ranked so high in the tech industry. It is interesting to think that even though I might not want to pursue a customer service/ technical support role, my current experience in these roles may very well help me down the line when applying for other IT jobs. I also found it quite interesting that most of the highest sort after skills were closely related to the current IT course we are all enrolled in. My opinion and goals for my ideal job have changed slightly in that it feels more and more reachable for me. </p>

<p>My opinion on my ideal job has not changed after looking at the Burning Glass data because I imagine I already have acquired some of the IT-specific and general skills. I believe that in the near future, I will be able to develop the skills that I have not yet gained. These skills include communication, leadership, Javascript and cloud computing.</p>
