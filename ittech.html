<h1> IT Technologies </h1>
<h2>Raspberry Pi's and Arduino's</h2>
<img src="pi.jpg" alt height="500px;"
  style="float:left;/* text-align; left;*/">
<p>The Raspberry Pi Project started in 2006 inspired by the success of the BBC Micro,an educational small computer using a microprocessor. This small powerhouse was created in the 1980’s and was a pivotal moment for personal-use computer history.

In 2012 the Raspberry Pi Project finally finished its prototype stage and sold its first line of computers for $30 a unit. Aimed towards young people to offer computers at a low cost, the Raspberry Pi Foundation became the fastest growing computing company to date, selling over a million units in its first year.
</p>

<p>The origin of the name ‘Raspberry Pi’ was originally coined to follow the trend of computer manufacturers naming products after fruits. However, this small computer’s name “Raspberry” was also hilariously chosen as a reference to the expression, ‘blowing a raspberry’. The “Pi” in Raspberry Pi references the python code needed to run the device.

The first Raspberry Pi included all the components needed to be able to operate as a normal computer. They include a CPU, RAM, USB Port, GPIO Pins and a HDMI slot. Nowadays, the more updated version also includes microHDMI LAN and an updated CPU of 4x 1.4Ghz, much like the regular personal computers we have today. The Raspberry Pi can do most things our desktops can, but with a more limited capacity. Due to this, Raspberry Pi’s have been used in place of normal desktops in locations where desktop PC’s might not be available or feasible.
</p>

<p> Due to the Raspberry Pi’s small stature however, along with its capability of a regular desktop computer, it can be used for other small projects. A Raspberry Pi is easily programmable, and allows its user to be able use the device to interact with the outside world. Thus, these small and cheap microprocessors can be used in a variety of projects such as lighting rigs, music machines, weather devices, and plant waterers. Because the Raspberry Pi reaches just 3 inches by 2 inches, it can be placed inconspicuously. </p>

<p> The Raspberry Pi’s primary language is Python. It comes pre-loaded into the machine, however it does also have the ability to run other computer languages as well.  One thing to take into consideration however, is if you choose to use Python 3 for your Raspberry Pi and you begin to write code in Python 2. This actually creates an incompatibility problem and your written code won't be able to run.

While most desktop computers run either Mac OS or Windows, the Raspberry Pi actually runs its own version of Linux called Raspbian. Raspbian is optimised for the Raspberry Pi and unlike other OS, comes with over 35,000 packages through a packet manager called “APT” or Advanced Packaging Tool which can be easily installed through the device itself. Many of these packages allow the user to install programs such as “Gimp” which is a powerful photoshop like program, “Fritzing” a program for drawing electronic circuits, and “Libreoffice”, an office suite containing programs such as Word and Spreadsheet. These packages allow for the many uses of the Raspberry Pi outside of just a standard computer OS.
 </p>

<p> Arduiono’s, unlike Raspberry Pi’s, are a less powerful tool that requires a separate PC to be able to program. While Raspberry Pi’s are completely self sufficient once plugged into a monitor and peripherals, Arduino’s are capable of being run on as little as a 9 volt battery and are a more popular choice for completing tasks that require simple task execution. Arduiono’s are more commonly used for smaller projects such as activating a motor, turning on an LED light or publishing something online. The user programs the Arduino through an existing computer and sends it a set of instructions for the Arduino to carry out. Unlike Raspberry Pi’s, Arduiono’s have the ability to run on Windows, Mac, and Linux. The capabilities of an Arduino can be extended through the utilisation of libraries. Many libraries come installed with the Arduino but more can be downloaded externally to fit the user’s needs.</p>

<p> The incredible thing about Raspberry Pi’s and other microprocessors is that they are forever expanding and adapting to how we want to use them. The fact that the Raspberry Pi’s, Arduiono’s and other microprocessors already have the ability to be able to add components per a user’s requirements, make use of a wide range of programs at the touch of a download button. These microprocessors can perform to a high functioning standard already which show that the future of Raspberry Pi’s and self made, self tailored computing experiences are not a thing of the future. It can be foreseen that the ability to take off and add on components will mean that many can now afford to have a powerful computing device that fits an individual's needs, and that will continue to be advanced for more complex and demanding projects.

<h2>Clouds, Services and Servers </h2>
<img src="Cloud.jpg" alt height="400px;"
  style="float:right;/* text-align; right;*/">
<p>
Cloud Computing is the delivery of IT resources and computing services, -such as storage, servers, databases, networking, software, etc-, through the internet (Oracle, 2022). According to Stashko (2021) a solution Architect at Avenga, the top five cloud service providers are the following: Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Alibaba Cloud, and Oracle. This innovative technology helps organisations of all types and sizes access secure, affordable, and upgradable computing solutions where they are offered friendly on-demand service, paying only for what is used.
<br>
<br>
There are three main types of cloud computing services, IaaS, PaaS, and Saas. As stated by Microsoft (2022), one of the leading cloud service providers, IaaS or “Infrastructure as a Service'' represents the essentials of cloud IT, granting access to data storing options, networking features, and virtual computers. Due to its simplicity, out of the three, IaaS is the most flexible option, consequently, giving customers more control over their technological experience. PaaS or “Platform as a Service” helps customers replace their hardware and operating systems, and with them, all of the aspects involved in their maintenance, planning, and functionality. Lastly, SaaS or “Software as a Service” provides the customer with ready-to-use software, most of the time in the form of  apps that are completely managed by the cloud provider (Microsoft, 2022).
Each one of these services provide the customer with different levels of control, flexibility, and use, therefore, it is important that interested organisations get acquainted with all three types in order to decide which one will suit them best.
<br>
<br>
Nowadays, thousands of different organisations use some form of cloud computing. Amazon Web Services (2022) has a repository containing more than 250 customer success stories, where companies of all types and sizes utilise this service.  Some great examples of cloud computing revision and advancement are as follows: that are worth revising are the following: For 20 years Coca-Cola had its own Traditional IT infrastructure, but back in 2013 migrated to AWS, since then, they have reduced operation costs by 40%. In 2021 Coca-Cola built a data lake on AWS increasing their analytics productivity by 80%. Epic Games is an American video game company that involves a large online player base. In 2018 they were presented with the urgent necessity of huge storing, analytical, and scalable services due to the record-breaking success of Fortnite, an online game that has had up to 15.3 million users connected at the same time (AWS, 2022).
<br>
<br>
Thanks to the flexibility, no matter the size, cloud computing can adjust to every need. Even multinational organisations that most definitely have the resources to have their own IT infrastructure are opting for cloud solutions.
<br>
<br>
Due to the increase in technological innovation and the recognition of growing opportunity, the necessity for cloud computing has become a quintessential part of the advancement of future tech.. To improve the understanding of the topic at hand, it is important to know how things were done before. In a traditional IT infrastructure, all processes have been run locally through physical hardware and servers. Most of the time, said elements have to be installed within the company's premises. Moreover, when improvements are required to fulfil new company necessities, it can only be achieved by either upgrading the existing hardware or buying more equipment. Finally due to its complex understanding and laborious maintenance, companies need skillful IT teams (Naser, 2021). The record breaking growth seen in cloud computing is attributed to the innovative and efficient way in which they solved many pain points concerning  traditional IT infrastructures. By removing the need to have self owned systems, cloud services reduce the need for laborious maintenance, expensive new equipment for upgrades, and the necessity of storing them physically on premises.
<br>
<br>
Cloud computing is a very successful technological advancement? Resulting in rapid market growth throughout the years. According to a study made by Cloudwards, in 2020 the cloud computing market was worth $371.4 billion USD, with a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 17.5%, the market is expected to have a value of $832.1 billion USD in 2025 (Sumina, 2022). This statistic demonstrates the monumental impact Cloud computing had in the last couple of years, although many argue COVID-19 lockdown was critical for this success, even outside a pandemic scenario its expected exponential growth for the forthcoming years is impressive. It can be foreseen that due to its potential, most companies will be involved in this growing market.
<br>
<br>
As a consequence of the huge impact on the industry, Cloud computing is changing IT jobs as we know them. While taking into consideration both narratives involved in the statement, Microsoft (2018) states that by 2020, an approximation of five million jobs would have been lost due to automation, on the other hand, approximately 80% of the jobs foreseen for 2025 currently not in existence yet. As much as the growth of cloud computing will inevitably make some jobs obsolete, it will also create many new ones. Most of the jobs that rely solely on a traditional IT infrastructure, such as IT Managers within an organisation, will be replaced by cloud automation. Nonetheless, many new jobs positions will likely  surge based on the growth in cloud necessities and companies.
<br>
<br>
Nowadays people live surrounded by cloud computing. Even if they might not realise it, it is likely a person will use at least one form of cloud computing in their everyday life. According to Roy Morgan Research Institute, approximately 12.7 million Australians use music streaming services (2020), over 14,000 education institutions of all sizes use AWS (AWS 2022)and Google Drive has grown to around 800 million monthly active users (Cadenas 2022). The Entertainment industry changed completely when cloud computing allowed streaming video and music, instead of having to download every single song into their device, users now have access to millions of songs within a couple of clicks and an internet connection. Due to the growth of cloud computing, companies such as Netflix and Spotify overthrew their corresponding market leaders and raised the bar for all their competitors. The best way to exemplify the uses of cloud in education is the COVID-19 lockdown, and how students were able to continue with their studies despite the situation. Storage capacity in phones was once the main priority, with the arrival of Icloud the necessity is now not so urgent, as photos, files, and information of millions of users is safeguarded with cloud computing.
<br>
<br>
As mentioned above, cloud computing is changing the IT job market, therefore, this will likely  have an impact on the students aspiring to work in this industry. There are several cloud computing courses available online. These range from an introductory level to advanced and complex topics. With the objective of exemplifying the previous statement, the top 3 online courses in 2022 are: “Introduction to Cloud Computing with Amazon Web Services” by Udemy , “Microsoft Azure Fundamentals AZ-900 Exam Prep Specialization” by coursera, and “Cloud Computing: The Big Picture By David Chappell'' by Pluralsight (Javinpaul 2022). In a world with constant technological innovation and progression, IT students need to be prepared to adapt and grow along with the industry. With the growing necessity for employees with these skills in the cloud computing industry, it is imperative that students undertake online courses and certifications to  acquire the latest skill sets desired by employers. Those who prioritise consistent  learning as this industry changes, will most likely be prioritised for similar positions over others.

<h2>Cybersecurity <img style="float: right;/* text-align; right;*/; position: relative; top: -15px" src="cybersecurity_pic.jpg" alt="photo" height="280px"></h2>
<p>Cybersecurity, also known as Information Technology Security, is the act of safeguarding delicate information so that it is not vulnerable to  attacks.  In today’s society, cybersecurity has many uses in day-to-day life such as two-factor authentication on social media accounts, browsers, emails and even for bank accounts. Another example of cybersecurity is having biometric technology on our phones such as Touch ID and Face ID on Apple devices. Privacy is something that is ever growing and needed in the future with more people breaching it, especially due to the fact that people’s lives are more online than ever before. The Australian Cyber Security Centre (2022) highlights that over 67,500 cyber-attacks were recorded in the 2020-2021 financial year and suggests that 23% of these attacks were caused by fraud.
<br>
<br>
As previously stated, cybersecurity has many uses in everyday life. Its benefits include protection from internal and external threats and cost-effectiveness (would cost more without cybersecurity if data were to be leaked) amongst other things. Many phones, or electronics in general, have certain features that help to protect the user’s information and privacy. These can range from general passwords and pins to facial or fingerprint recognition. Furthermore, two factor authentication was introduced to stop or mitigate hackers from exploiting sensitive information. It is claimed that users need to have:
<br>
<br>
‘two separate, distinct forms of identification in order to access something. The first factor is a password and the second commonly includes a text with a code sent to your smartphone, or biometrics using your fingerprint, face, or retina.’ (Kenton, 2022).
<br>
<br>
Network cybersecurity is a type of cybersecurity that involves the defence against threats  and access to the network. Some of these technologies include firewalls, anti-virus software and even having a Virtual Private Network (VPN). Firewalls are extremely important because they put up a barrier between your trusted internal network and untrusted outside networks, such as the Internet. (What is Network Security, n.d). In addition, the use of an anti-virus software allows the detection and deletion of malware, which can cause extreme harm to one's computer and personal assets.. Some of these damages may include stealing your data, encrypting it to prevent you from accessing your own system, or even erasing it completely (What is an antivirus product? Do I need one?, 2019). Moreover, VPNs protect users from hackers accessing their browsing history, IP address and identity theft. These are just some of the current technologies that are within the stream of cybersecurity.
<br>
<br>
In the next couple of years, cybersecurity will have had many advances. As threats and cyber attacks are becoming more sophisticated and difficult to find and eradicate, cybersecurity must also improve so that it can detect these attacks and deal with them. One such advancement could be the inclusion of  artificial intelligence (AI) to be able to detect and wipe out attacks. To do this, AI must have a “watch and learn” approach so that they can understand and differentiate between malware and normal usage. This is beneficial because it enables not only a much faster response to the threat, but also the detection of new and undiscovered cyber attacks Furthermore, rather than being reliant on having physical credit cards, payments could be made through a bank account that uses facial recognition or some other means of biometric technology. Browne (2022) suggests that Mastercard is trialling a new technology that allows payment using the user’s face or hand. Although this technology has already been created and used by China, it is currently not used anywhere else. In the near future, all first world countries may be able to utilise these types of payments, especially in a world where COVID-19 still exists, as it promotes contactless payment.
